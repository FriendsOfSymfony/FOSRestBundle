Getting Started With FOSRestBundle
=====================================

## Installation

Installation is a quick (I promise!) 1 step process:

1. [Setting up the bundle](1-setting_up_the_bundle.md)

## Bundle usage

FOSRestBundle provides several tools to assist in building REST applications:

- [The view layer](2-the-view-layer.md)
- [Listener support](3-listener-support.md)
- [ExceptionController support](4-exception-controller-support.md)
- [Automatic route generation: single RESTful controller](5-automatic-route-generation_single-restful-controller.md)
- [Automatic route generation: multiple RESTful controllers](6-automatic-route-generation_multiple-restful-controllers.md)

### Config reference
Check out the [configuration reference](configuration-reference.md) for a reference on the available configuration options.


### Example application(s)

The following bundles/applications use the FOSRestBundle and can be used as a
guideline:

- The LiipHelloBundle provides several examples for the RestBundle:
  https://github.com/liip/LiipHelloBundle

- There is also a fork of the Symfony2 Standard Edition that is configured to
  show the LiipHelloBundle examples:
  https://github.com/lsmith77/symfony-standard/tree/techtalk

- The FOSCommentBundle uses FOSRestBundle for its api:
