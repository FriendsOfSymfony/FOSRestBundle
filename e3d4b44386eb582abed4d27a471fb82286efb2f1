@GuilhemN Do you remember why we flagged these services as lazy in #1252?

According to https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/lazy_services.html#why-lazy-services, I guess they are marked as **lazy** because only 1 of them is really used at last. The alias `fos_rest.serializer` points to the selected serializer. No need to instanciate them all.
