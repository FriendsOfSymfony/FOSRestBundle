Do we really need this, isn't it better to rely on listeners priority?

@xabbuh do you want to me to open a PR as I apparently forgot several changes ?
most of the doc introduced in https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/pull/908/files is irrelevant now (it isn't possible anymore to use the twig config to enable the FOSRestBundle exception listener).

You mean updating the docs? I think that would be good (and we should check if we can trigger a deprecation in 1.8 in case someone use this way).
