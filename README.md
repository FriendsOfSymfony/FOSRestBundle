State
-----

While the provided feature set is certainly production ready, this Bundle is still under development.
As a result users must expect BC breaks when using the master version. Such breaks will however be
noted in the [UPGRADING.md](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/blob/master/UPGRADING.md).
A new version of the Bundle will be tagged in most cases before a BC break, however do not expect bug
fixes for these tagged versions.
